Bonus 2 — Data Insights (Anomalies & Inconsistencies Found)

I analyzed the dataset returned by the /messages API and identified several interesting anomalies and inconsistencies:

1. Inconsistent Message Field Names

Different messages contain different fields for text content:

message

text

content

body

Some wrapped under "data" objects

Impact:
A naive implementation would fail to extract text consistently. My solution handles all variants.

2. Mixed Schema Structures

The API sometimes returns:

{ "items": [...] }

{ "messages": [...] }

Or directly a list [...]

Impact:
The service needs flexible normalization logic.

3. Variation in Message Types

Some records appear to be:

Full sentences

Metadata-like short messages (e.g., “ok”, “thanks”)

Emoji-only messages

System-generated entries

Impact:
Short/noisy messages reduce semantic relevance. I added a relevance threshold.

4. Name Ambiguities

Some messages reference:

Single names (e.g., “Layla”)

Full names

Nicknames

Users with similar names

Impact:
User reference resolution is approximate and purely textual.

5. Inconsistent Date Formats

Messages contain dates in formats such as:

“April 12, 2025”

“2025-04-12”

“04/12/25”

Impact:
Extracting structured dates would require normalization, but out-of-scope for the current minimal solution.

6. Missing or Partial Data

Some users have rich message histories; others have:

1–2 messages

messages with no meaningful content

incomplete event details (“I’ll be traveling soon”)
